    "A) To prove that the E step update on membership (\\pi) achieves the minimum objective given the current centroids (\\mu) in K-means clustering, we need to show that the E step minimizes the within-cluster sum of squared distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function of K-means clustering is defined as the sum of squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid. Let's denote the objective function as J.\n",
    "\n",
    "J = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\pi_{ik} * ||x_i - \\mu_k||^2\n",
    "\n",
    "where N is the number of data points, K is the number of clusters, \\pi_{ik} is the membership of data point i to cluster k, x_i is the data point, and \\mu_k is the centroid of cluster k.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the E step, we update the membership (\\pi) by assigning each data point to the nearest centroid. This assignment minimizes the distance between each data point and its assigned centroid. Therefore, given the current centroids (\\mu), the E step achieves the minimum objective value because it assigns each data point to the centroid that minimizes the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) To prove that the M step update on centroids (\\mu) achieves the minimum objective given the current memberships (\\pi) in K-means clustering, we need to show that the M step minimizes the within-cluster sum of squared distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function J remains the same as mentioned earlier. In the M step, we update the centroids (\\mu) by computing the mean of the data points assigned to each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\mu_k = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\pi_{ik} * x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\pi_{ik}}\n",
    "\n",
    "The M step calculates the centroid that minimizes the sum of squared distances within each cluster. By taking the mean of the data points assigned to a cluster, the centroid is positioned at the center of the cluster, minimizing the sum of squared distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "C) K-means clustering algorithm stops when it converges, which means that there is no further improvement in the objective function or the centroids' positions. However, K-means may converge to a local minimum instead of the global minimum objective value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence of K-means is guaranteed because the algorithm alternates between the E step and M step, which monotonically decreases the objective function at each iteration until convergence. At each iteration, the objective function decreases or remains the same, and eventually, the algorithm reaches a point where there is no further decrease in the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, K-means is sensitive to the initial positions of the centroids and may converge to a local minimum, which is not necessarily the global minimum objective value. Different initializations can lead to different final cluster assignments and centroids. To mitigate this issue, multiple runs with different initializations can be performed, and the solution with the lowest objective value can be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, K-means clustering algorithm converges to a local minimum objective value, but it does not guarantee convergence to the global minimum objective value due to its sensitivity to initializations."
